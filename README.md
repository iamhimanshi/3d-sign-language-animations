3D Sign Language Animations

This project showcases 3D animations for Indian Sign Language (ISL) built using Three.js.
It focuses on visualizing basic gestures like Hello, Bye, and Thank you using a 3D animated character.

Objective

The goal of this project is to make communication more inclusive by combining 3D technology and sign language gestures.
In the future, this will be integrated into a text-to-sign translator web application.

 Simple and clean codebase structure

Technologies Used

Three.js → for rendering and animation
GLTF / GLB models → for 3D characters and motion
HTML, CSS, JavaScript → for basic structure and styling



** Note **
This project is currently in development.
All animations are based on Indian Sign Language (ISL) and created for educational and research purposes.
> Character base model taken from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) by Adobe.
> All sign animations are created by me.
